\abstract{
  This thesis describes the search for a new heavy boson decaying to a pair of bosons (\WW, \WZ, or \WH) in the semileptonic final state (lepton, missing transverse energy, and jet), using the data obtained from proton-proton collisions in the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the Large Hadron Collider.
  The data used were collected during the Run 2 detection period, with integrated luminosities of 35.9, 41.5, and $59.7\unit{fb^{-1}}$ recorded for the years of 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.
  The analysis performed makes use of a novel two-dimensional signal extraction technique performed in the plane of the diboson invariant mass and soft drop jet mass, with the search performed in the resonance mass range from 1.0 to $4.5\unit{TeV}$.
  Results are obtained in terms of asymptotic exclusion limits, with no significant deviation from Standard Model predictions observed.
  In the appendix of this work, we also present studies towards a novel muon tracking algorithm for the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the future High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider.
