\section{Introduction}

% Accelerators vs. cosmic rays
Accelerators have been at the heart of particle and nuclear physics since they first came online in the mid-20th century.
Initial experiments that established the existence of familiar particles such as muons and pions utilized cosmic rays, and cosmic rays are still used today for various projects such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory~\cite{Abbasi_2009}.
However, accelerator facilities offer numerous advantages over using cosmic rays.
One is that the energies of the beams may be controlled by experimenters, which allows for studying the energy dependence of interactions.
Another is that the projectile type in the beam may be chosen in order to select for certain interactions.
Finally, the interactions take place at a specified location where detectors may be located.

% Fixed-target accelerators
The center-of-mass energy $E_\mathrm{CM}$\footnotemark{} is a defining feature of an accelerator, as it is a measure of the energy available to produce particles in collision events~\cite{martin2008particle}.
\footnotetext{Sometimes instead written in terms of the Mandelstam variable $s$ as $\sqrt{s}=E_\mathrm{CM}$~\cite{Perelstein_2011}.}
There are two types of accelerators to consider: fixed-target and colliders. % Check terms
A key distinction between them is how they differ their center-of-mass energies based on the parameters of the accelerator.
Fixed-target accelerators involve a single beam that is directed to a stationary target in the lab frame, with a center-of-mass energy given by
\begin{equation}
  E_\mathrm{CM}=\sqrt{m_b^2c^4+m_t^2c^4+2m_tc^2E_L},
\end{equation}
where $m_b$ is the mass of the particles in the beam, $m_t$ is the mass of the particles in the stationary target, and $E_L$ is the energy of the beam as measured in the lab frame.
While the beam energy can be calibrated, this form of $E_\mathrm{CM}$ goes as $\sqrt{E_L}$ for high beam energies.

% Colliders
On the other hand, colliders involve two beams of particles that are directed to cross into each other and collide at a fixed position where the detectors are located.
In this case, given two beams with energies $E_{L,1}$ and $E_{L,2}$ as measured in the lab frame, the center-of-mass energy is simply
\begin{equation}
  E_\mathrm{CM}=E_{L,1}+E_{L,2},
\end{equation}
and if $E_{L,1}=E_{L,2}=E_L$, this reduces to $E_\mathrm{CM}=2E_L$.
Thus, colliders have the advantage that they depend linearly on beam energy and therefore have higher gains in $E_\mathrm{CM}$ compared to fixed-target accelerators.

% Luminosity
Another key parameter of an accelerator is the luminosity $\mathcal{L}$.
Given a cross-section $\sigma$ for a process, and a rate at which events occur $R$, the luminosity is the constant of proportionality such that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:evtRate}
  R=\mathcal{L}\sigma,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}$ has units of cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. % Check how to stylize units
In some cases it is useful to instead consider the time integral of the luminosity $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{int}$, which is given by
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{int}=\int\mathcal{L}\dd{t}.
\end{equation}
This can then be used with equation~\ref{eq:evtRate} to obtain the number of collision events $N_\mathrm{event}$ for a process:
\begin{equation}
  N_\mathrm{event}=\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{int}\sigma.
\end{equation}
Thus, by increasing the luminosity (and hence the integrated luminosity), we may increase the number of collision events of interest for a given process.
The luminosity may also be expressed in terms of parameters relevant to the beam, as it is essentially an instantaneous measure of particle flux. % Check wording
For example, given the number of particles per bunch for two Gaussian beams $N_1$ and $N_2$, revolution frequency $f$, and number of bunches $N_b$, the luminosity is
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}=f\frac{N_1N_2N_b}{4\pi\sigma_x\sigma_y},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$ are the standard deviations in the $x$ and $y$ directions for the beam distributions~\cite{Herr:941318}.

% Discoveries at colliders
The search for new physics has driven advances in accelerator center-of-mass energies and luminosities that allow for discovering exotic collision events.
Fig.~\ref{fig:ECMplot} shows the constituent center-of-mass energies for various accelerator facilities as a function of the year in which they came online~\cite{Panofsky}.
These advances have resulted in the discovery of massive particles that the first accelerators in the 1960's were not capable of producing, such as the $W$ and $Z$ bosons, or the top quark. % Check wording
Even following the success of the Higgs boson discovery in 2012 and the ongoing search for new particles at the LHC, there are still upgrades being installed on the LHC to increase its luminosity, and there are proposals for new accelerator facilities with higher center-of-mass energies~\cite{Bicer_2014}.

% Chapter overview
This chapter explores the main features of the Large Hadron Collider facility at CERN in section~\ref{sec:LHC}, where collision events used in the search were obtained.
A complete documentation of the LHC machine can be found in Ref.~\cite{Evans:1129806}.
We then turn our attention to the Compact Muon Solenoid detector in section~\ref{sec:CMS} and briefly go over some of the main components of the device, which was used to record the collision events at the LHC.
This overview is based off of documents concerning CMS in Ref.~\cite{Chatrchyan:1129810}.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
\label{sec:LHC}

The Large Hadron Collider is a circular collider accelerator facility with two superconducting rings that accelerate protons to relativistic speeds, and it is located just outside of Geneva on the French-Swiss border.
It is the largest and most powerful collider in the world, with plans to extend its service life into the 2030's and 2040's.
It has a circumference of 26.7 km and was built into an existing tunnel that was used for the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider, which was used from 1989 to 2000.
Various detectors used to study collision events are placed along the beamline, such as ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb.
Fig.~\ref{fig:CERN} shows the complete CERN accelerator complex with all of its components.
The ATLAS and CMS facilities are general-purpose detectors for studying the Higgs and searching new physics arising from proton-proton collision, while ALICE is optimized for studying heavy-ion collisions with stripped lead ions ($^{208}$Pb$^{82+}$) to investigate properties of quark-gluon plasma, and LHCb is designed to study the physics of bottom quarks and $CP$ violation in $b$-hadron interactions.

% Beam injection for LHC
The LHC beam is fed through a multi-stage process in which protons are stripped off of hydrogen atoms and are first accelerated through a series of preaccelerators before being injected into the LHC beam.
Protons start at the Linac2 facility, where they are initially accelerated to $50\unit{MeV}$ before being transferred to the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) and reach $1.4\unit{GeV}$.
They are then sent to the Proton Synchrotron (PS) where they reach energies of $25\unit{GeV}$, and then they are accelerated further to $450\unit{GeV}$ at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).
The protons then reach the LHC where they are accelerated to $6.5\unit{TeV}$ each.
The process is similar for lead ions, where they instead start at Linac3 with $4.2\unit{MeV/n}$, then move through the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) before being transferred to the PS, then the SPS, then injected into the LHC.

% Center-of-mass energy and luminosity
While the LHC was built with the intent of achieving center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=14\unit{TeV}$ in proton-proton collisions, the data collected for this work was over a period in which the center-of-mass energy was $\sqrt{s}=13\unit{TeV}$.
It also has a specific expression for the luminosity $\mathcal{L}$ given by
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}=\frac{N_b^2n_bf_\mathrm{rev}\gamma_r}{4\pi\epsilon_n\beta^*}F,
\end{equation}
where $N_b$ is the number of particles per bunch, $n_b$ is the number of bunches per beam, $f_\mathrm{rev}$ is the revolution frequency, $\gamma_r$ is the Lorentz factor, $\epsilon_n$ is the normalized transverse beam emittance, $\beta^*$ is the beta function at the collision point, and $F$ is the geometric luminosity reduction factor.
Both ATLAS and CMS are the main high luminosity experiments, with integrated luminosities of $35.9\unit{fb^{-1}}$, $41.5\unit{fb^{-1}}$, and $59.7\unit{fb^{-1}}$ recorded at CMS over the Run 2 years 2016, 2017, and 2018.
This corresponds to a total integrated luminosity of $137.1\unit{fb^{-1}}$ at CMS over Run 2.
