\section{Data and Simulation Samples}
\label{sec:samples}

% The need for simulation samples of signal and background
This search uses the proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS detector during Run 2.
The data are collected and stored for analysis after events generate trigger primitives in the detector subsystems and get passed through the HLT as described in chapter~\ref{chap:exp}.
We also list the MC signal samples used in the analysis that are based on the BSM models of subsection~\ref{subsec:benchmark}.
Additionally, we list the MC samples that model SM background contributions to the search.

\subsection{Data Samples}

% Data samples
The data used for this work are based on three different sets over the three Run 2 years of 2016, 2017, and 2018.
For each year of Run 2, documentation is available for the luminosity measurements~\cite{CMS-PAS-LUM-17-001,CMS-PAS-LUM-17-004,CMS-PAS-LUM-18-002}.
The full dataset is divided into three sets per year, with contributions from the \texttt{SingleMuon}, \texttt{SingleElectron}, and \texttt{MET} sets.
The 2016 Rereco (Re-MiniAOD 03Feb2017) set for Run2016B-H with an integrated luminosity of $35.9\unit{fb^{-1}}$ is listed in table~\ref{tab:dataSamples2016}.
For 2017, the Rereco (31Mar2018) set for Run2017B-F with $41.5\unit{fb^{-1}}$ is listed in table~\ref{tab:dataSamples2017}.
Finally, the 2018 Rereco (17Sep2018 for Run2018A-C, 22Jan2019 for Run2018D) with $59.7\unit{fb^{-1}}$ is listed in table~\ref{tab:dataSamples2018}\footnote{This set excludes the PromptReco for MET 2018D.}.

\subsection{Signal Samples}
\label{sec:sigSamples}

% Signal samples
This analysis makes use of ten benchmark signal models, which are listed in tables~\ref{tab:ggFGBulkToWWSamples}-\ref{tab:VBFZprToWWSamples} with their cross sections and branching ratios where appropriate.
The signal models used are \ggF/\VBF\GBulktoWWtolnuqqbarpr, \ggF/\VBF\RadtoWWtolnuqqbarpr, \DY/\VBF\WprtoWZtolnuqqbar, \DY/\VBF\WprtoWHtolnubbbar, and \DY/\VBF\ZprtoWWtolnuqqbarpr.
Each signal has different samples with 50,000 events for each year of Run 2, for a total of three sets of samples per signal.
Furthermore, each signal has separate samples with 50,000 events for the following resonance masses: 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, and $4.5\unit{TeV}$\footnote{The 2016 \VBF\ZprtoWW and 2016 \VBF\WprtoWZ sets are the exception to this, lacking mass values below $1.2\unit{TeV}$.}.
The 2016 \VBF\ZprtoWW and 2016 \VBF\WprtoWZ samples do not have mass values below $1.2\unit{TeV}$, and some samples have masses that extend from $4.5\unit{TeV}$ to $8\unit{TeV}$ in increments of $0.5\unit{TeV}$.
These samples were generated as part of the \texttt{RunIISummer16MiniAODv2}, \texttt{RunIIFall17MiniAODv2}, and \texttt{RunIIAutumn18MiniAOD} campaigns.
The parameters for each signal model can be found at the following references~\cite{git:BulkGrav_WW,git:Wpr_WZ,git:Wpr_WH,git:VBFRad_WW}.

% GbulktoWW details
The \ggF\GBulktoWW model assumes a curvature of $\tilde{k}=0.5$, and the NLO QCD predicted cross section is taken to be 25 times larger than the number at the following link\footnote{\url{https://github.com/CrossSectionsLHC/WED/blob/master/KKGraviton\_Bulk/GF\_NLO\_13TeV\_ktilda_0p1.txt}}, where $\tilde{k}=0.1$, then multiplied by the branching fraction of \GBulktoWW in the ``$WW$'' column of this link\footnote{\url{https://github.com/CrossSectionsLHC/WED/blob/master/KKGraviton\_Bulk/Decay\_long.txt}}. % Links don't work

% DY ZprtoWW, DY WprtoWZ, and DY WprtoWH details
The leading order cross sections in the Heavy Vector Triplet (HVT) model B\footnote{As discussed in reference~\cite{Pappadopulo_2014}.} for \DY\ZprtoWW, \DY\WprtoWZ, and \DY\WprtoWH from this link\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jngadiub/Cross\_Sections\_HVT/blob/master/13TeV.txt}} are used. % Link doesn't work
For the \Zpr cross section, we use the values from the ``CX0(pb)'' column and multiply them with the branching fraction to $WW$ in the ``BRWW'' column.
The \Wpr cross section values are obtained by taking the sum of the numbers from the ``CX+(pb)'' and ``CX-(pb)'' columns and multiplying the result by the branching fraction to either $WZ$ or $WH$, which are found in the ``BRZW'' and ``BRWh'' columns.

% VBF ZprtoWW and DY WprtoWZ details
The \VBF\ZprtoWW and \DY\WprtoWZ samples use cross sections from the HVT model C with $c_\mathrm{H}=3$, which are taken from this reference\footnote{\url{https://github.com/zucchett/HVT/blob/master/dataframe.csv}}.
The \Zpr cross section is obtained from the ``Zprim\_cH3'' column and multiplied with the branching fraction to $WW$ in the ``BrZprimeToWW'' column.
Similarly for the \Wpr cross section, we take the values from the ``Wprime\_cH3'' column and multiply them with the branching fraction to $WW$ in the ``BrWprimeToWZ'' column.

\subsection{Background Samples}

% Background samples
Finally, MC samples are also used to simulate SM background contributions, as listed in tables~\ref{tab:bkg2016Samples} and \ref{tab:bkg2017Samples} along with their cross sections.
These background samples include various processes that are broadly categorized as \Wjets and \WVt, some of which include DY+jets, QCD, and $t\bar{t}$ production samples.
The background samples were generated in the same \texttt{RunIISummer16MiniAODv2}, \texttt{RunIIFall17MiniAODv2}, and \texttt{RunIIAutumn18MiniAOD} campaigns as for the signal samples.
