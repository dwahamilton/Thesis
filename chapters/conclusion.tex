% Summary of chapter
This chapter presents a search for a heavy dibosonic resonance decaying semileptonically to \WW, \WZ, and \WH, with spin-0 and spin-2 resonances produced via \ggF and \VBF, and spin-1 resonances produced via \DY and \VBF.
The data used were collected from 2016 to 2018 during Run 2 of the LHC, corresponding to center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=13\unit{TeV}$ and a total integrated luminosity of $137.1\unit{fb^{-1}}$.
This analysis is performed with a novel 2D signal extraction technique that performs a simultaneous fit for the diboson invariant mass \MVV and soft drop jet mass \MJ, with several benchmark models used to model the hypothetical resonance.
The results obtained are considered in terms of asymptotic exclusion limits for the production cross section times the branching ratio for each benchmark model, with no significant deviations from the median expected limits observed for the \ggF and \DY production modes, and a possible excess reaching a $3.3\sigma$ deviation observed at $1\unit{TeV}$ for the spin-1 \VBF production modes.
