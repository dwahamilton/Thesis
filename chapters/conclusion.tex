% Summary of analysis chapter
This chapter presents the search for a heavy dibosonic resonance decaying semileptonically to \WW, \WZ, and \WH, with spin-0 and spin-2 resonances produced via \ggF and \VBF, and spin-1 resonances produced via \DY and \VBF.
The data used were collected from 2016 to 2018 during Run 2 of the LHC, corresponding to center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=13\unit{TeV}$, and a total integrated luminosity of $137.2\unit{fb^{-1}}$.
This analysis is performed with a novel 2D signal extraction technique that performs a simultaneous fit for the diboson invariant mass \MVV and soft drop jet mass \MJ, with several benchmark models used to model the hypothetical resonance.
The results obtained are considered in terms of asymptotic limits for the production cross section times the branching fraction for each benchmark model, with no significant deviations from the median expected limits observed for any of the benchmark signal models.
The observed limits establish exclusion limits on the resonances masses for the \DY- and \ggF-produced signal models.
