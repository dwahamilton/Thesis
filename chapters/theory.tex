\chapter{Theory and Motivation for Searching for a Heavy New Resonance}
\label{chap:theory}

\section{Introduction}

% History of QFT
Prior to the development of the Standard Model, attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics with special relativity resulted in the foundations for quantum field theory.
The first example of a successful quantum field theory is quantum electrodynamics (QED), which was principally developed by Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger.
For their work in QED, they shared the 1965 Nobel Prize along with Sin-Itiro Tomonaga~\cite{NobelPrize:1965-Physics}.
To this day, it stands as one of the most precisely tested theories of physics, with quantities such as the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron $a_e$ as predicted by QED agreeing with experiment by more than 10 significant digits~\cite{Aoyama_2015}.

% Development of the SM
However, while QED on its own is successful within its own domain of modeling electromagnetic interactions, it does not concern itself with the other two interactions of the Standard Model: the strong and weak nuclear forces.
The description of these two forces proved to be more mathematically complicated than QED, and the development of the quantum field theories that describe them did not come about until the 1960's and 1970's with the electroweak (EW) theory of Weinberg, Glashow, and Salam, and the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) of Gell-Mann and Zweig.
EW theory and QCD also have their roots in Yang-Mills theory developed by Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills in the 1950's~\cite{1954PhRv...96..191Y}, as they are both examples of non-abelian gauge theories.
The Standard Model is the resulting theory that came about by combining EW theory with QCD\footnote{While the theory itself began development in the 1960's, the term ``Standard Model'' was coined by Pais and Treiman in 1975~\cite{CaoFieldTheory}.}.

% Problems with the SM
Today, the Standard Model remains as the dominant theory describing three of the four known forces, with gravity excluded due to its inability to be renormalized when approached as a quantum field theory.
The theory itself stands as one of the most well-tested models of physics in history, and all elementary particles predicted by the theory have been found, with the Higgs boson completing the family after being discovered in the summer of 2012.
However, despite the success of this theory, many fundamental questions of physics still remain unanswered.
As previously mentioned in chapter~\ref{chap:intro}, the theory does not include gravity, as it only accounts for the electromagnetic, strong, and weak nuclear forces.
It also does not account for the existence of Dark Matter or Dark Energy, and there are long-standing issues that the theory currently is incapable of addressing, such as the hierarchy problem~\cite{krippendorf2010cambridge}.
The theory is therefore regarded as incomplete, and efforts to find physics beyond the Standard Model are ongoing.

% Chapter overview
In this chapter, we briefly explore the main aspects of the Standard Model in section~\ref{sec:SM}, looking at the fundamental particles that it describes and some of its mathematical foundations.
Later, in section~\ref{sec:search}, we describe the theoretical background relevant to the search for a new fundamental particle beyond the Standard Model that this work presents.

\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}
\label{sec:SM}

% The standard model
The Standard Model is the prevailing theory in particle physics that classifies all known elementary particles, and describes how they interact with each other via the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces.
Mathematically, the Standard Model is a gauge quantum field theory resulting from the combination of both EW theory and QCD.
Attempts at simply quantizing relativistic particles in the same way that nonrelativistic particles were quantized gives rise to problems such as negative-energy states and violations of causality~\cite{Peskin:257493}.
The need for the field description therefore arises from requiring that our theory obeys causality in the context of relativity, and that our theory allows for the creation and annihilation of particles.
Each elementary particle and antiparticle is associated with a field, individual particles are treated as excitations of the field, and the interactions between each of the different fields allow for the creation and annihilation of particles.

\subsection{The Elementary Particles}
\label{subsec:particles}

% The elementary particles
The Standard Model describes the interactions between the elementary particles, which are classified by quarks, leptons, gauge bosons, and scalar bosons.
A table of all particles described by the theory can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:standardModel}, labeled with their masses, charges, and spins~\cite{PhysRevD.98.030001}, with the fermions grouped by generation.
Quarks and leptons are classified as fermions since they have half-integer values for their spin, while the scalar and gauge bosons are eponymously named for the fact that they are bosons and therefore have integer values for their spin.

  }
  \label{fig:standardModel}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Quarks}

% Quarks
Quarks are spin-1/2 particles that interact via the strong and weak nuclear forces, as well as the electromagnetic force.
The up and down quarks make up the protons and neutrons of everyday matter that we see and interact with.
For example, a proton is made up of two $u$'s and one $d$ ($uud$), while a neutron is made of two $d$'s and one $u$ ($ddu$).
These are just two of the many different combinations of composite particles that can be formed by quarks.

% Combinations of quarks
There are two main combinations of quarks to consider: mesons and baryons.
Mesons are composed of one quark and an antiquark, and baryons are composed of three quarks or three antiquarks.
For example, pions ($\pi^0$/$\pi^\pm$) were the first mesons to be observed, and can be electrically charged when comprised only of up or down quark-antiquark pairs (i.e., a $\pi^+$ is made from the combination $u\bar{d}$, and a $\pi^-$ is made from $d\bar{u}$), or it can be electrically neutral (i.e., a $\pi^0$ is made from $u\bar{u}$ or $d\bar{d}$).
On the other hand, protons and neutrons are examples of baryons, as they are each made of three quarks.
Both baryons and mesons are examples of hadrons: bound states of quarks.

% Color charge
One unique aspect of quarks is that they carry color charge, and all hadrons are considered `colorless' states.
The three quarks in a baryon have red, green, and blue (or antired, antigreen, and antiblue) charge to form a colorless combination, and mesons can come in pairs of red and antired, green and antigreen, and blue and antiblue.
This phenomenon is known as color confinement, and while there is currently no analytic proof of color confinement in QCD, no colorless configuration of quarks has been observed~\cite{muta2010foundations}.

\subsubsection{Leptons}

% leptons
Leptons, like quarks, are also spin-1/2 particles that can be electrically charged.
Unlike quarks, they only interact via the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces.
The electron is the most familiar lepton, as it is a component of the atoms that are found in everyday interactions.
However, it also has two heavier cousins: the muon and the tau.
Both of these particles have the same charge as the electron, but their masses are much larger.
Finally, leptons also include neutrinos, which are extremely light particles that have no electric charge, and therefore only interact via the weak force.

\subsubsection{Gauge Bosons}

% Gauge bosons
The gauge bosons include the gluon, the photon, and the $W$ and $Z$ bosons.
Each gauge boson is a spin-1 particle that mediates the three fundamental interactions that the Standard Model describes.
Gluons are massless particles that mediate the strong nuclear force, and they only interact with quarks since they are the only particles to carry color charge.
Photons are the most familiar example of the gauge bosons, as we can quite literally see them since light is made of photons.
They are masses particles that mediate the electromagnetic force, and they interact with any particle that is electrically charged.
Finally, the $Z$ and $W$ bosons are massive particles that mediate the weak nuclear force, which is responsible for radioactive decay.

\subsubsection{Scalar Bosons}

% Scalar bosons
The last category of bosons to consider is the scalar bosons, which are spin-0 particles.
This family contains only one member: the Higgs boson.
The need for the Higgs boson arises due to the fact the previously mentioned massive gauge bosons ($W$ and $Z$) do not have intrinsic masses.
Rather, the Higgs boson is responsible for giving the massive gauge bosons their masses.
This occurs through the Higgs mechanism, in which spontaneous symmetry breaking and gauge invariance cause the Higgs field to interact with the $W$ and $Z$ fields in the Standard model, thereby imparting the observed masses onto the particles.

\subsection{Mathematical Structure of the Standard Model}

% The mathematical structure of the standard model
As the Standard Model is a quantum field theory, it has a Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{SM}$ that contains all the information about the fields corresponding to each particle and how they interact with each other.
%Each term in this Lagrangian must be Lorentz invariant in order for the Lagrangian to remain the same under gauge transformations or boosts and rotations.
The terms present in $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{SM}$ allow us to compute probability amplitudes for particle production and decay processes through the method of Feynman diagrams.
The Standard Model is also a non-abelian gauge theory, in which the internal symmetry group is $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$~\cite{Srednicki:1019751}.
The $SU(3)_C$ symmetry group corresponds to the QCD interactions of the quarks and gluons, while the $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ group corresponds to the electroweak interactions.
The symmetries of these groups lead to conservation of color charge $C$, weak isospin $T_3$, and weak hypercharge $Y_W$\footnote{Electric charge $Q$ arises as a linear combination of $T_3$ and $Y_W$ given by $Q=T_3+\frac{1}{2}Y_W$.}.

\subsubsection{Lagrangian Formalism}

% The QED Lagrangian
A simple yet illustrative example of a Lagrangian for a quantum field theory is that of QED for a spin-1/2 field~\cite{Klauber:2013ipa}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:QED}
  \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QED}=-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+\bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu-m)\psi.
\end{equation}
Here, $\psi$ is a spin-1/2 field, $\bar{\psi}\equiv\psi^\dagger\gamma^0$ is the Dirac adjoint for $\psi$, $F^{\mu\nu}=\partial^\mu A^\nu-\partial^\nu A^\mu$ is the electromagnetic field strength tensor, $D_\mu=\partial_\mu+ieA_\mu$ is the gauge covariant derivative, $\gamma^\mu$ is the set of Dirac matrices, and $m$ is the mass of the particle corresponding to the field $\psi$.

% Equations of motion
The classical equations of motion for the fields can be obtained through the Euler-Lagrange equation for a field $\phi$, which is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EL}
  \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{\phi}-\partial_\mu\bqty{\pdv{\mathcal{L}}{(\partial_\mu\phi)}}=0.
\end{equation}
Applying equation~\ref{eq:EL} to the spin-1/2 field $\psi$ yields
\begin{equation}
  (i\gamma^\mu D_\mu-m)\psi=0,
\end{equation}
which is the Dirac equation with the gauge covariant derivative in place of the usual partial derivative.
On the other hand, for $A^\mu$, we get
\begin{equation}
  \partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu}=e\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\psi,
\end{equation}
which are the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic field.

%\subsubsection{Feynman Diagrams}

% Feynman diagrams
%Feynman diagrams are pictorial representations of the terms in present in the Dyson series, which is a perturbative expansion of the time evolution operator in the interaction picture.
%Through the process of canonical quantization, one may obtain a quantum field theory starting from a Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$~\cite{Lancaster:1629337}.
%The Lagrangian contains all the information about how the fields interact with one another, and from this we may obtain the Feynman rules to compute scattering amplitudes and cross sections.

% Example with QED Lagrangian
%For example, given the QED Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QED}$ in equation~\ref{eq:QED}, we obtain the following Feynman rules~\cite{Schwartz:2013pla}:
%\begin{equation}
%  \begin{aligned}
%    \input{fig/theory/QEDpropPhoton.tex} &= \frac{-ig_{\mu\nu}}{p^2+i\epsilon}, & \input{fig/theory/QEDphotonIncoming.tex} &= \epsilon_\mu(p), & \input{fig/theory/QEDphotonOutgoing.tex} &= \epsilon_\mu^*(p),\\
%    \input{fig/theory/QEDpropFermion.tex} &= \frac{i(\slashed{p}+m)}{p^2-m^2+i\epsilon}, & \input{fig/theory/QEDfermionIncoming.tex} &= u^s(p), & \input{fig/theory/QEDfermionOutgoing.tex} &= \bar{u}^s(p),\\
%    \input{fig/theory/QEDvert.tex} &= -ie\gamma^\mu, & \input{fig/theory/QEDantifermionIncoming.tex} &= \bar{v}^s(p), & \input{fig/theory/QEDantifermionOutgoing.tex} &= v^s(p).
%  \end{aligned}
%\end{equation}

%For example, given the QED Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QED}$ in equation~\ref{eq:QED}, the resulting Feynman rules may immediately be applied to a process such as $e^-e^+\to\mu^-\mu^+$ to obtain the first-order scattering amplitude,
%\begin{equation}
%  i\mathcal{M}=\input{fig/theory/QEDfeyn.tex}=\frac{ie^2}{(p_1+p_2)^2}\bqty{\bar{v}(p_2)\gamma^\mu u(p_1)}\bqty{\bar{u}(p_3)\gamma_\mu v(p_4)}.
%\end{equation}
%This can then be used to compute the scattering cross section.
%For a process in the center-of-mass frame with two particles in the initial state with momenta $\vb{p}_1=-\vb{p_2}$, and two particles in the final state with momenta $\vb{p}_3=-\vb{p}_4$.
%The cross section assuming unpolarized scattering is
%\begin{align*}
%  \dv{\sigma(e^-e^+\to\mu^-\mu^+)}{\Omega} &= \frac{1}{64\pi^2\ECM^2}\frac{|\vb{p}_f|}{|\vb{p}_i|}\sum_\mathrm{spins}|\mathcal{M}|^2\\
%  &= \frac{\alpha^2}{4\ECM^2}\sqrt{1-\frac{m_\mu^2}{E^2}}\bqty{1+\frac{m_\mu^2}{E^2}+\pqty{1-\frac{m_\mu^2}{E^2}}\cos^2\theta},
%  \numberthis
%\end{align*}
%\begin{equation}
%  \dv{\sigma(e^-e^+\to\mu^-\mu^+)}{\Omega}=\frac{\alpha^2}{4\ECM^2}\sqrt{1-\frac{m_\mu^2}{E^2}}\bqty{1+\frac{m_\mu^2}{E^2}+\pqty{1-\frac{m_\mu^2}{E^2}}\cos^2\theta},
%\end{equation}
%where $|\vb{p}_i|\equiv|\vb{p}_1|=|\vb{p}_2|$ and $|\vb{p}_f|\equiv|\vb{p}_3|=|\vb{p}_4|$, $\ECM$ is the total energy in the center-of-mass frame, $E=\ECM/2$ is the energy of one of the incoming or outgoing particles, $\theta$ is measured with respect to the axis of the initial momenta, and $m_\mu$ is the mass of the muon.

% Feynman diagrams generalized to the standard model
%The process for obtaining scattering cross sections for other field theories with a specified Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$ is similar.
%Thus, applying this machinery to the SM Lagrangian allows us to construct the diagrams necessary to compute scattering amplitudes and cross sections for any particular process of interest.
%Some examples of SM vertices may be seen in figure~\ref{fig:SMVert}~\cite{Romao_2012}.

%\begin{figure}[htbp]
%  \centering

%    For the quartic electroweak vertex, the two particles interacting with the $W$'s must be chosen such that charge conservation holds.
%  }
%  \label{fig:SMVert}
%\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Gauge Theory}

% Gauge theory
One of the most foundational aspects of the Standard Model is the notion of gauge invariance, which means that the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$ remains invariant under a set of transformations.
The invariance of the Lagrangian under these transformations leads to conservation laws as a consequence of Noether's theorem.
This is at the heart of the Standard Model and why it is a $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ gauge theory.

% Example with Dirac Lagrangian
To see this, consider the Dirac Lagrangian for a spin-1/2 field given by
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Dirac}=\bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m)\psi.
\end{equation}
This Lagrangian is invariant under the global $U(1)$ transformation $\psi\to e^{i\alpha}\psi$, as $\bar{\psi}\to e^{-i\alpha}\bar{\psi}$ and the product $\bar{\psi}\psi$ remains the same.
However, if we insist on a local $U(1)$ transformation such that $\psi\to e^{i\alpha(x)}\psi$, then the invariance is broken since the transformed Lagrangian obtains an additional term:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}\to\mathcal{L}-\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu[\partial_\mu\alpha(x)]\psi.
\end{equation}

% Introducing the gauge field
The symmetry can be restored by adding an interaction term with a gauge field $A_\mu$ in the Lagrangian and demanding that it transform along with $\psi$, and by adding interaction term $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{int}$:
\begin{equation}
  A_\mu\to A_\mu-\frac{1}{e}\partial_\mu\alpha(x),\qquad \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{int}=-e\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu A_\mu\psi.
\end{equation}
But introducing the gauge field requires that we also add a kinetic term $-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ for $A_\mu$, with $F^{\mu\nu}=\partial^\mu A^\nu-\partial^\nu A^\mu$.
Then the full Lagrangian is now
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}=-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+\bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m)\psi-e\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu A_\mu\psi=-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+\bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu-m)\psi,
\end{equation}
where $D_\mu=\partial_\mu+ieA_\mu$ is the gauge covariant derivative.
This is in fact the QED Lagrangian of equation~\ref{eq:QED}.
Thus, $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QED}$ is exhibits a local $U(1)$ symmetry, and applying Noether's theorem to the $U(1)$ gauge transformations reveals that the conserved quantity under this symmetry is electric charge.

% Gauge theory applied to the standard model
This same process can be applied to the overall $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ gauge group to obtain conservation of color charge $C$, weak isospin $T_3$, and weak hypercharge $Y_W$.
The method of introducing a gauge field and replacing ordinary derivatives with gauge covariant derivatives to obtain local gauge symmetry is known as the minimal coupling rule~\cite{cheng1984}.
While the example of local $U(1)$ symmetry with the QED Lagrangian is simpler due to the fact that $U(1)$ is an abelian group, the process is similar for the non-abelian groups such as $SU(3)$ and $SU(2)$.
%The number of generators for the gauge group corresponds to the number of gauge fields that are introduced to the Lagrangian.
%For example, the EW symmetry group $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ has four generators, each of which correspond to the four EW bosons ($W^+$, $W^-$, $Z$, $\gamma$).
Thus, the gauge bosons are named for the fact that their fields naturally arise from demanding local gauge symmetry for the SM Lagrangian.

\subsubsection{The Higgs Mechanism}

% The need for the Higgs mechanism
One lingering issue arising from introducing the gauge fields is that the fields are required to be massless, otherwise the mass terms arising from the fields would spoil the gauge invariance.
For QCD this is not an issue since gluons are massless.
However, for EW theory this is a problem since the photon is massless, but the $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons are not.

% Example with a simple model
The Higgs mechanism solves this through spontaneous symmetry breaking by introducing a scalar field that interacts with the gauge fields in such a way that the masses are imparted onto them.
To see this mechanism in action, we may consider a simple model with a complex scalar field $\phi=\phi_1+i\phi_2$ with the following Lagrangian~\cite{GriffithsParticle}:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\phi)^*(\partial^\mu\phi)+\frac{1}{2}\mu^2(\phi^*\phi)-\frac{1}{4}\lambda^2(\phi^*\phi)^2.
\end{equation}
By inspection, this Lagrangian has a $U(1)$ global symmetry under the transformation $\phi\to e^{i\theta}\phi$.
However, in order to apply perturbation theory so that we may use Feynman diagrams to compute scattering amplitudes, the Lagrangian must be defined so that the fields are shifted to the global minimum of the potential. %\footnote{The potential in this case is $\mathcal{U}(\phi,\phi^*)=-\frac{1}{2}\mu^2(\phi^*\phi)+\frac{1}{4}\lambda^2(\phi^*\phi)^2$ since $\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{T}-\mathcal{U}$.}.
%We may do so by noticing that the minimum of the potential lies on a circle of radius $\mu/\lambda$ in $(\phi_1,\phi_2)$ space, and rewriting $\mathcal{L}$ in terms of new fields $\eta$ and $\xi$ defined by
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:fields}
%  \eta=\phi_1-\mu/\lambda,\qquad \xi=\phi_2,
%\end{equation}
%and the Lagrangian is now
We may do so by noticing that the minimum of the potential lies on a circle of radius $\mu/\lambda$ in $(\phi_1,\phi_2)$ space, and by rewriting $\mathcal{L}$ in terms of new fields $\eta\equiv\phi_1-\mu/\lambda$ and $\xi\equiv\phi_2$, the Lagrangian is now
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{L} &= \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\xi)(\partial^\mu\xi)+\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\eta)(\partial^\mu\eta)-\mu^2\eta^2\\
    &\equad- \bqty{\mu\lambda(\eta^3+\eta\xi^2)+\frac{\lambda^2}{4}(\eta^4+\xi^4+2\eta^2\xi^2)}+\frac{\mu^2}{4\lambda^2}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Reading off the quadradic terms in $\mathcal{L}$ reveals that the fields have acquired masses $m_\eta=\sqrt{2}\mu$ and $m_\xi=0$.

% Spontaneous symmetry breaking
However, the Lagrangian no longer exhibits the global $U(1)$ symmetry that was present when written in terms of $\phi$ and $\phi^*$, and there is now a massless field $\xi$ present.
This phenomenon in which the original symmetry is no longer present is known as spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the introduction of a massless scalar field is a consequence of Goldstone's theorem, which states that the spontaneous breaking of a continuous global symmetry is accompanied by the presence of a massless Goldstone boson~\cite{PhysRev.127.965}.
Evidently, $\xi$ is the Goldstone boson present in the theory.

% Local gauge symmetry revisited
We may repeat this process but instead promote the original global $U(1)$ symmetry to a local symmetry and take the usual approach of introducing a gauge field $A^\mu$ and gauge covariant derivative $D_\mu=\partial_\mu+ieA_\mu$.
%Our Lagrangian is now
%\begin{equation}
%  \mathcal{L}=-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+\frac{1}{2}(D_\mu\phi)^*(D^\mu\phi)+\frac{1}{2}\mu^2(\phi^*\phi)-\frac{1}{4}\lambda^2(\phi^*\phi)^2.
%\end{equation}
%and if we apply the same shift in the fields $\eta$ and $\xi$ so that the potential is instead written about the minimum, we obtain
After applying the shift in the fields $\eta$ and $\xi$ so that the potential is instead written about the minimum, the new Lagrangian with the gauge field is
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{L} &= \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\xi)(\partial^\mu\xi)+\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\eta)(\partial^\mu\eta)-\mu^2\eta^2-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{e^2\mu^2}{\lambda^2}A_\mu A^\mu\\
    &\equad+ e[\eta(\partial_\mu\xi)-\xi(\partial_\mu\eta)]A^\mu+\frac{e^2\mu}{\lambda}\eta A_\mu A^\mu+\frac{1}{2}e^2(\xi^2+\eta^2)A_\mu A^\mu\\
    &\equad- \lambda\mu(\eta^3+\eta\xi^2)-\frac{1}{4}\lambda^2(\eta^4+2\eta^2\xi^2+\xi^4)+\frac{e\mu}{\lambda}(\partial_\mu\xi)A^\mu+\frac{\mu^4}{4\lambda^2}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Again we have a massive $\eta$ field, and now the gauge field $A^\mu$ has acquired a mass $m_A=e\mu/\lambda$.
But there are two problems: the Goldstone boson $\xi$ is still present, and there is now a term in $\mathcal{L}$ of the form $(\partial_\mu\xi)A^\mu$.
Any term in the Lagrangian that is bilinear in two different fields indicates that $\mathcal{L}$ is not written in terms of fields corresponding to physical particles.

% The Higgs mechanism in action
Both issues are resolved by applying a gauge transformation to the original fields $\phi$ and $\phi^*$ so that $\phi\to e^{i\theta}\phi$ and $\phi^*\to e^{-i\theta}\phi^*$, with $\theta=-\arctan(\phi_2/\phi_1)$.
This is equivalent to setting $\phi_2=0$, which means that $\xi=0$ as well.
Since the Lagrangian is invariant under the $U(1)$ gauge transformation, we are left with all terms that do not contain $\xi$, and hence
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{L} &= \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\eta)(\partial^\mu\eta)-\mu^2\eta^2-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{e^2\mu^2}{\lambda^2}A_\mu A^\mu+\frac{e^2\mu}{\lambda}\eta A_\mu A^\mu\\
    &\equad+ \frac{1}{2}e^2\eta^2A_\mu A^\mu-\lambda\mu\eta^3-\frac{1}{4}\lambda^2\eta^4+\frac{\mu^4}{4\lambda^2}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Thus, the Goldstone boson is eliminated, we are left with the massive scalar field $\eta$ and the massive gauge field $A^\mu$, and the gauge field has also acquired a longitudinal polarization state in the process.

% The Higgs mechanism applied to the standard model
The Higgs mechanism is ultimately the result of combining spontaneous symmetry breaking and local gauge invariance~\cite{Higgs:1964ia}, and applying this process to the $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ EW theory accounts for the masses of the electroweak $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons, while also introducing the Higgs field itself.
It is for this reason that discovering the Higgs boson was of the utmost importance in verifying the Standard Model's description of the electroweak sector.
Meanwhile, the fermions gain their masses through a Yukawa interaction with the Higgs field.

\subsection{Beyond the Standard Model}
\label{subsec:BSM}

% Overview of BSM
The incompleteness of the Standard Model has driven theoretical developments of alternative models that resolve its shortcomings~\cite{2010arXiv1005.1676L}.
A few examples are Grand Unified Theories, supersymmetry (SUSY), and models based on extra spatial dimensions.
While such theories are currently of high interest due to the prospect of superseding the Standard Model, some are based on developments that predate the Standard Model itself.

\subsubsection{The Hierarchy Problem}

% The hierarchy problem
One major outstanding issue of interest relevant to this work is the inability of the Standard Model to deal with the hierarchy problem.
Using three fundamental constants, one may define the Planck mass as
\begin{equation}
  m_P=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}}\approx1.22\times10^{19}\unit{MeV/\clight^2},
\end{equation}
where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant.
This defines an energy scale at which effects due to gravity would become apparent in particle physics experiments~\cite{QFTNutshell}.
However, this energy scale is vastly larger than what can be obtained in contemporary accelerators.
Figure~\ref{fig:hierarchy} shows the comparison between the Planck scale, the electroweak symmetry breaking scale, and the current center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ at the Large Hadron Collider.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \input{fig/theory/hierarchy.tex}
  \caption{
    Comparison between the electroweak scale, LHC center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}$, and Planck scale in eV.
    The hierarchy problem arises due to the unexplained difference between the Planck scale at which gravitational effects become apparent and the energy scale at which electroweak symmetry breaking occurs, which are 17 orders of magnitude apart.
  }
  \label{fig:hierarchy}
\end{figure}

% Correcting the Higgs mass
The issues caused by the hierarchy problem are more apparent when considering the mass corrections to the Higgs boson.
The Higgs boson mass $m_H$ is corrected through one-loop Feynman diagrams that are proportional to $m_H^2$~\cite{Martin_1998}, two examples of which can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:higgsFeyn}.
Such corrections require a momentum cutoff $\Lambda$ when evaluating the loop integrals obtained from the diagrams, and if the cutoff is on the same order as $m_P$, the correction to $m_H^2$ ends up being far larger than the required value.
While this effect only directly applies to $m_H^2$, the rest of the massive SM particles are indirectly sensitive to the cutoff $\Lambda$ due to the fact that they gain their masses through the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field $\ev{H}$, meaning that the mass spectrum of the SM is sensitive to $\Lambda$.
It also does not suffice to simply pick a sufficiently small cutoff, as this requires new physics at the energy scale of $\Lambda$ to change the behavior of the propagators in the one-loop mass correction terms.

% Addressing the hierarchy problem
In the absence of some mechanism that resolves this issue, we are left with having to fine-tune parameters of the Standard Model in order to address the hierarchy problem.
On the other hand, some BSM theories seek to address this problem in a more natural manner that does not require such fine-tuning.
Such theories result in new physics that may be experimentally verified, with some predicting the existence of new heavy particles that could be detected in collision events at the LHC.

\subsubsection{Supersymmetric Theories}

% Supersymmetry
Supersymmetry extends the notion of local symmetry to fermionic and bosonic fields, suggesting that there are symmetry transformations that mix the fields into each other~\cite{Wess197452}.
SUSY theories suggest that every known fermion has a corresponding bosonic partner, and every known boson has a corresponding fermionic partner.
For example, the electron would have a spin-0 supersymmetric partner known as the `selectron', and there would be other supersymmetric partners such as `squarks' and `sneutrinos'.
Bosonic particles would have partners such as the `photoino', `gluino', 'wino', and 'zino'.
However, one main issue is that no such supersymmetric partners have been identified, and the simplest models predict that they should have the same mass as their SM partners.
This suggests that if there is a supersymmetric theory that turns out to be correct, there must be a spontaneously broken symmetry mechanism that causes supersymmetric partners to differ in mass from their SM partners~\cite{dine_2007}.

\subsubsection{Grand Unified Theories}

% Grand unified theories
Grand Unified Theories are largely inspired by the success of the electroweak unification.
In the same way that the electromagnetic and weak forces become a single interaction at a particular energy scale, GUTs aim to unify the strong force with the other two forces of the Standard Model.
This requires a symmetry group that contains the $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ group as a subgroup.
The first example of a GUT was the Georgi-Glashow model that was based on the $SU(5)$ group~\cite{PhysRevLett.32.438}.
A unique aspect of such theories is that they often predict that the proton is unstable and can decay due to new gauge bosons that couple quarks to leptons\footnote{Such particles are often called `leptoquarks'~\cite{Diaz_2017}.}.
However, proton decay has not been observed~\cite{PhysRevLett.81.3319}, and the current lower bound for the lifetime of the proton is inconsistent with the Georgi-Glashow model.
Despite this, there are still other models based on more complex groups, such as $E_6$~\cite{Hewett1989193} or $SO(10)$~\cite{Cveti__1997}, that are candidates for further investigation.

\subsubsection{Warped Extra Dimensions}

% Warped extra dimensions
There are many BSM theories that suggest that there are extra spatial dimensions, some of which are based on work done well before the formulation of the Standard Model.
Classical Kaluza-Klein theory has its roots in the early 20th century, and its main feature is the addition of a fourth spatial dimension~\cite{1921spaw966K}.
It is a unified field theory that combines gravity and electromagnetism, and it rests on the idea that the extra spatial dimension is compactified in such a way that makes it experimentally difficult to observe.
The integration of electromagnetism into the theory neatly follows from symmetry considerations due to the extra spatial dimension.

% Randall-Sundrum models
Such work involving extra dimensions has paved the way for later theoretical developments in the field.
Randall-Sundrum (RS) models are examples of this, which propose that there is an extra fourth spatial dimension that has a strongly warped geometry~\cite{PhysRevLett.83.4690}.
These models are based on the idea that the spatial dimensions of the universe are restricted to a brane embedded within a higher-dimensional space known as the ``bulk.''
In such a framework, the elementary particles---except for the graviton---are localized in (3+1)-dimensional branes, while the graviton is able to propagate in the bulk.
The warped geometry is such that there are two branes in these models: the Tevbrane where the SM particles are localized, and the Planckbrane where the gravitational force becomes much stronger.

\section{Search for a Heavy Diboson Resonance}
\label{sec:search}

% Search for a heavy diboson resonance
This thesis presents results on the search for a new heavy $X$ resonance, with the resonance then decaying into a pair of bosons as part of efforts to explore BSM physics at the LHC.
The decays of interest are \XtoWV and \XtoWH, where $V=W^\pm,Z$ is any of the three massive electroweak vector bosons and $H$ is the Higgs boson discovered at the LHC in 2012.
We consider semileptonic final event states in which the $W$ decays leptonically via \Wtolnu, where $\ell$ is either an electron or a muon, as this provides a clean experimental signature and an efficient online event selection.
The other \VorH boson decays hadronically through the process \Vtoqqbarpr or \Htobbbar and is reconstructed as a single massive jet.
Three production modes are considered based on the benchmark models used: vector boson fusion (\VBF), gluon-gluon fusion (\ggF), and Drell-Yan (\DY) production.
For \ggF and \DY processes there are no additional objects produced in the event, but for \VBF processes there are two forward-facing jets.

% Previous work
This work is motivated in part by models such as those mentioned in subsection~\ref{subsec:BSM}, and is a continuation of a previous search using the 2016 data collected by the LHC during Run 2~\cite{Sirunyan_18}.
The previous analysis was conducted using only two benchmark signal models, and it was agnostic to the method of production for an $X$ resonance.
This work instead uses four benchmark signal models and considers multiple production methods.

\subsection{Narrow Resonance Models}
\label{subsec:benchmark}

% List of signal models used
The search conducted in this work is model independent---it is not specific to a signal model and can cover many possibilities for an $X$ resonance.
However, benchmark models based on the BSM theories described in subsection~\ref{subsec:BSM} are used in order to model hypothetical collision events in the LHC that result in the final event states of interest.
The structure of these events then informs us about making our selection cuts for our search, as will be discussed in chapter~\ref{chap:analysis}.
This search covers spin-0, spin-1, and spin-2 bosonic resonances, and is based on the following benchmark models:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Spin-0 Kaluza-Klein Radion:} A neutral scalar boson appearing in RS models that can decay to the vector bosons $W$ and $Z$ via \RadtoWW and \RadtoZZ~\cite{Goldberger_1999,Goldberger_2000}.
  \item \textbf{Spin-1 \Wpr/\Zpr Boson:} A heavier version of the spin-1 $W$ and $Z$ bosons that can decay via \WprtoWZ, \WprtoWH, \ZprtoWW, and \ZprtoZH~\cite{Pappadopulo_2014}.
  \item \textbf{Spin-2 Bulk Graviton:} A spin-2 resonance from a bulk RS model that decays via \GBulktoWW and \GBulktoZZ~\cite{Fitzpatrick_2007,PhysRevD.76.036006}.
\end{enumerate}

% Motivation for using signal models
These benchmarks cover a wide range of possibilities for candidate BSM bosonic resonances to be discovered.
The models used also assume a narrow resonance, which means that the internal width of the resonance is smaller than the resolution of the experiment.
Despite the variety in signal models, they may all result in similar semileptonic final states, thereby allowing the analysis to be model independent.
Furthermore, based on previous searches that have been conducted, they are all expected to be in the TeV mass range.

\subsubsection{Model Parameters}
\label{subsec:param}

% GBulk parameters
The Kaluza-Klein Radion and Bulk Graviton benchmark models make use of common parameters because they are both based on RS theories.
In particular, the metric considered with the extra spatial dimension $\varphi$ is given by~\cite{carvalho2018gravity}
\begin{equation}
  \dd{s}^2=e^{-2kr_c\varphi}\eta_{\mu\nu}\dd{x}^\mu\dd{x}^\nu+r_c^2\dd{\varphi}^2,
\end{equation}
where $0\leq\varphi\leq\pi$, $r_c$ is the finite size of the $\varphi$ dimension, $x^\mu$ are the familiar 4D spacetime coordinates, $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ is the Minkowski metric, and $k$ is the curvature factor given by
\begin{equation}
  k\equiv\sqrt{\frac{-\Lambda}{24M_5^2}}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\Lambda$ is the vacuum energy density on the branes/bulk, and $M_5$ is the 5D Planck mass.
The Bulk Graviton model used for this analysis is parameterized in terms of the dimensionless curvature given by $\tilde{k}\equiv{k/\overline{M}_P}$, where $\overline{M}_P^2=\frac{M_5^3}{k}(1-e^{2\pi kr_c})$ is the 4D Planck mass obtained by integrating out the extra dimension $\varphi$.

% Rad parameters
For the Radion model, there are two parameters that are considered.
The first is the dimensionless combination $kr_c$, given by
\begin{equation}
  kr_c=\frac{1}{\pi}\ln\pqty{3.83\tilde{k}\frac{\overline{M}_P}{M_G}},
\end{equation}
where $M_G$ is the graviton mass.
The second parameter $\Lambda_R\equiv e^{-\pi kr_c}\sqrt{\frac{6M_5^3}{k}}$ determines the strength of the coupling of the Radion with matter in the interaction Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_\Rad=-\frac{1}{\Lambda_R}\Rad a_iT^{\mu(i)}{}_\mu,
\end{equation}
where the $a_iT^{\mu(i)}{}_\mu$ are interaction terms obtained from taking the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T^{\mu\nu}$, with $i$ denoting the type of matter field in the interaction (i.e., massive gauge bosons or fermions).

% W'/Z' parameters
Meanwhile, the \Wpr/\Zpr model considered for \ggF and \DY processes is the Heavy Vector Triplet (HVT) model B, and model C for \VBF processes, as described in reference~\cite{Pappadopulo_2014}.
The model introduces a spin-1 field $\rho_\mu$ that transforms under the $SO(4)$ group, with a Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_\rho=-\frac{1}{4\hat{g}'^2}(B_{\mu\nu})^2-\frac{1}{4\hat{g}^2}(W_{\mu\nu}^a)^2+\frac{f^2}{4}d_\mu^id^{\mu i}-\frac{1}{4g_\rho^2}(\rho_{\mu\nu}^a)^2+\frac{m_\rho^2}{2g_\rho^2}(p_\mu^a-e_\mu^a)^2.
\end{equation}
The field strength tensor for $\rho$ is $\rho_{\mu\nu}^a=D_{[\mu}V_{\nu]}^a-\epsilon^{abc}V_\mu^bV_\nu^c-W_{\mu\nu}^a$, where $V_\mu^a\equiv\rho_\mu^a+W_\mu^a$ is the vector triplet for which the model is named.
Meanwhile, the $d_\mu^i$ and $e_\mu^a$ terms contain interactions between the Higgs fields and other fields, $f$ is the Goldstone-Boson-Higgs decay constant, and $g_\rho$, $\hat{g}$, and $\hat{g}'$ are coupling constants.
For the parameters of the models, it is convenient to instead rewrite the coupling constants as
\begin{equation}
  g_V=g_\rho,\qquad \frac{1}{g^2}=\frac{1}{\hat{g}^2}+\frac{1}{\hat{g}_\rho^2},\qquad g'=\hat{g}'.
\end{equation}
There are several parameters that describe the three variants of the HVT models, but for this analysis we are interested only in three: $g_V$, $c_H$, and $c_F$, which describe the interaction strength of the new vector bosons, Higgs boson coupling, and fermion coupling, respectively.
In terms of other model parameters, the two couplings are
\begin{equation}
  c_H=\frac{g_V}{\sqrt{g_V^2-\tilde{c}_{VW}^2g^2}}\pqty{\tilde{c}_H+\frac{g^2}{g_V^2}\tilde{c}_{VW}},\qquad c_F=\frac{g_V}{\sqrt{g_V^2-\tilde{c}_{VW}^2g^2}}(\tilde{c}_F+\tilde{c}_{VW}),
\end{equation}
where the $\tilde{c}$ quantities are transformed versions of the original $c$ couplings and the subscripts denote the interaction terms they couple to.
For model B, $g_V\leq4\pi$, $c_H\approx1$, and $c_F\approx1$, while for model C the fermionic couplings are zero, with $g_V\approx1$ and $c_F=0$.

\subsection{Expected Event Structure}
\label{subsec:expEvent}

% Event structure
The decay processes \XtoWVtolnuqqbarpr and \XtoWHtolnubbbar were chosen due to the fact that one-lepton events are ideal for such an analysis, as the final states that are generated provide a clean signal that suppresses background.
Furthermore, the semileptonic final state is also a good compromise for search sensitivity since it is cleaner than an all-hadronic final state, and it produces more expected signal than an all-leptonic state.
The \ggF and \DY production modes produce only the \lnuqqbarprp and \lnubbbar semileptonic final states resulting from the decay of the $X$ resonance.
Meanwhile, while the \VBF production channel is rarer than the \ggF and \DY production modes by a factor of 10 to 100, its particular event signature further suppresses background events and uniquely results in forward-facing jets~\cite{rauch2016vectorboson}.
All benchmark models used in this analysis are capable of this production mechanism.
Such a process has been used in the past as one of the discovery channels for the Higgs boson, and it remains an important class of events at the LHC.
%The \ggF and \DY production modes produce identical \lnuqqbarprp and \lnubbbar semileptonic final states, but without the \VBF jets in the forward regions of the detector.
The spin-0 Kaluza-Klein Radion and spin-2 Bulk Graviton models both have \ggF production modes, while the spin-1 \Wpr and \Zpr models can be produced via a \DY process.
Examples of Feynman diagrams for all three production processes of an $X$ resonance with the resulting final states can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:productFeynman}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \input{fig/theory/productFeyn.tex}
  \caption{

    The search for an $X$ boson will involve looking for a final state in which there is a single merged jet from the \VorH boson, a lepton $\ell$ with its corresponding neutrino produced from the $W$ decay, and in the case of \VBF production, two forward-facing jets.
  }
  \label{fig:productFeynman}
\end{figure}

% Event topology
Because the expected mass of the bosonic resonance lies in the TeV range, the final event state has a highly boosted topology, which is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:eventTop}.
The two initial state quarks from the \VBF process in the diagram of figure~\ref{fig:productFeynman} result in two forward-facing jets in the final state that are highly energetic and collimated.
Meanwhile, the lepton-neutrino pair from the \Wtolnu decay will have momenta opposite to that of the jet that results from the hadronic decay of the \VorH boson.
The jet from the \Vtoqqbarpr or \Htobbbar decay will also have two-pronged substructure since the decay results in a quark-antiquark pair.
Lastly, both the lepton-neutrino pair and the jet will be highly collimated since the $W$ and \VorH bosons that produced them will have momenta of several hundred GeV or above.

    Finally, the \VBF production process results in two forward-facing jets, labeled by $q^{(\prime)\prime}$ and $q^{((\prime)\prime)\prime}$, which are colored red.
