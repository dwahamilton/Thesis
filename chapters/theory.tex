\chapter{Theory and Motivation for Searching for a Dibosonic Resonance}
\label{chap:theory}

\section{Introduction}

The search for new particles has been an ongoing endeavor since the first accelerators came online in the mid-20th century.

% More history here

Today, the Standard Model remains as the dominant theory describing three of the four known forces, with gravity excluded due to its inability to be renormalized when approached as a quantum field theory.
The theory itself stands as one of the most well-tested models of physics in history, and all elementary particles predicted by the theory have been found, with the Higgs completing the family after being discovered in the summer of 2012.
However, despite the success of this theory, many fundamental questions of physics still remain unanswered.
As previously mentioned, the theory does not include gravity, as it only accounts for the electromagnetic, strong, and weak nuclear forces.
It also does not account for the existence of Dark Matter or Dark Energy, and there are long-standing issues that the theory currently is incapable of addressing, such as the hierarchy problem.
The theory is therefore regarded as incomplete, and efforts to find physics beyond the Standard Model are ongoing.

In this chapter, we briefly explore the main aspects of the Standard Model in section~\ref{sec:SM}, looking at its mathematical foundations and the fundamental particles that it describes.
Later, in section~\ref{sec:VBF}, we describe the theoretical background relevant to the search for a new fundamental particle beyond the Standard Model that this thesis presents.

\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}
\label{sec:SM}

The Standard Model is the prevailing theory in particle physics that classifies all known elementary particles, and describes how the interact with each other via the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces.
The theory came about during the 1960's in order to explain observations made during early collision experiments\footnotemark.
