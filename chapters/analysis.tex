\chapter{Search for a Heavy Diboson Resonance Produced via Vector Boson Fusion}
\label{chap:analysis}

\section{Introduction}

% Motivation of analysis from theory chapter
In chapter~\ref{chap:theory}, we explored some of the motivation behind BSM searches and examples of BSM theories that predict exotic new particles that may be found in collision events at accelerator facilities.
We also enumerated some of the benchmark models from BSM theories, which were the spin-0 Kaluza-Klein Radion, spin-1 $W'$/$Z'$ boson, and spin-2 Bulk Graviton.
Additionally, we discussed the VBF production mode that this work focuses on, and the final state that is produced.

% Previous searches
Previous searches have been conducted for dibosonic resonances at both CMS and ATLAS, although none have found evidence of such a resonance being observed at the LHC~\cite{Sirunyan_18,Aaboud_18,Aaboud_18_2,Aad_15,Khachatryan_14,Sirunyan_17,Sirunyan_17_2,atlas20}.
Some of these searches also considered different production modes, as well as other intermediate and final states, such as a $ZZ$/$ZH$ resonance with fully leptonic or hadronic final states.
As mentioned in section~\ref{sec:VBF}, this analysis is itself a continuation of a previous search by the CMS collaboration for a dibosonic resonance using data from 2016.

% VBF analysis as part of the main analysis
While this work focuses on the VBF production mode, it is one of three modes considered for the full diboson analysis using the Run 2 data.
The other two modes considered involve gluon-gluon fusion (\ggF) and Drell-Yan (\DY) processes.
These additional modes produce identical \lnuqqbarprp and \lnubbbar semileptonic final states, but without the VBF jets in the forward regions of the detector.
For completeness, we include the full diboson analysis with the non-VBF production categories in this chapter.
Figure~\ref{fig:nonVbf} shows some example Feynman diagrams of other processes that were considered for the full analysis.

% Details of reconstructing events
In subsection~\ref{subsec:expEvent} we discussed the expected event structure for the decay events of interest, in which the leptonic decay of the $W$ boson results in an $e\nu$ or $\mu\nu$ pair with large missing transverse energy from the neutrino, the hadronic decay of the $V$/$H$ boson results in a large single jet with substructure, and VBF processes produce forward-facing jets.
The boosted topology is a result of the fact that the resonances considered have masses in the TeV range, which causes the $W$ and $V$/$H$ bosons to have transverse momenta on the order of several hundred GeV.
This requires the use of specialized techniques to identify and reconstruct the individual $W$ and $V$/$H$ bosons based on information from the reconstructed lepton, missing transverse energy of the neutrino, and two-pronged substructure of the jet.
Additionally, the signal models used for the analysis assume that the resonance width is narrow, meaning that the decay width of the resonance in the $WV$/$WH$ diboson mass spectrum is smaller than the experimental resolution.

% Details on modeling background
A unique aspect of the previous analysis that this work inherits is a novel signal extraction method, in which the SM background contribution is estimated from the data using a two-dimensional (2D) maximum likelihood fit.
This process is performed in the plane formed by the mass of the jet from the $V$/$H$ decay \MJ, and the invariant mass of the $WV$/$WH$ diboson system \MVV.
Two classes of SM background events are considered for this analysis.
The first is a \WVt background that is resonant in the \MJ spectrum, and the second is a \Wjets contribution that is non-resonant in \MJ.
One advantage of using a 2D fit is the ability to retain more events for modeling background in the sideband regions within the 2D \MJ-\MVV plane, as opposed to looking at the sidebands in the \MJ and \MVV spectra separately.
This also allows for conducting a simultaneous search of $WW$, $WZ$, and $WH$ resonances as opposed to performing separate analyses in pre-defined \MJ windows.

% Chapter overview
For this chapter, we examine the complete analysis process of the search for a dibosonic resonance produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC with center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=13\unit{TeV}$.
The data used in this analysis were collected over 2016, 2017, and 2018 with integrated luminosities of $35.9\unit{fb^{-1}}$, $41.5\unit{fb^{-1}}$, and $59.7\unit{fb^{-1}}$, respectively.
Section~\ref{sec:samples} provides an overview of the data and simulation samples that were used for the analysis.
In section~\ref{sec:events}, we discuss the selection cuts used to determine which events are used from the data and simulation samples.
We then go over the SM sources of background and how they are taken into account for the analysis in section~\ref{sec:bkg}, followed by the signal modeling process in section~\ref{sec:sig}.
The fit validation and bias testing procedures are described in section~\ref{sec:bias}, after which we discuss the results of the search in section~\ref{sec:results}.

\section{Data and Simulation Samples}
\label{sec:samples}

% The need for simulation samples of signal and background
This search uses the proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS detector during Run 2.
The data are collected and stored for analysis after events generate trigger primitives in the detector subsystems and get passed through the HLT as described in chapter~\ref{chap:exp}.
We also list the signal samples used in the analysis that are based on the BSM models of subsection~\ref{subsec:benchmark}.
Additionally, we list the samples that model SM background contributions to the search.
Complete lists of each sample used are found in appendix~\ref{chap:appendixSamples}.

% Data samples
The data are listed in tables~\ref{tab:dataSamples2016}-\ref{tab:dataSamples2018}, along with their integrated luminosities.
For each year of Run 2, documentation is available for the luminosity measurements~\cite{CMS-PAS-LUM-17-001,CMS-PAS-LUM-17-004,CMS-PAS-LUM-18-002}.
The data are divided into three sets per year, with contributions from the \texttt{SingleMuon}, \texttt{SingleElectron}, and \texttt{MET} sets.

% Signal samples
This analysis makes use of ten benchmark signal models, which are listed in tables~\ref{tab:ggFGBulkToWWSamples}-\ref{tab:VBFZprToWWSamples} with their cross sections and branching ratios.
The signal models used are \ggF/\VBF\GBulktoWWtolnuqqbarpr, \ggF/\VBF\RadtoWWtolnuqqbarpr, \DY/\VBF\WprtoWZtolnuqqbar, \DY/\VBF\WprtoWHtolnubbbar, and \DY/\VBF\ZprtoWWtolnuqqbarpr.
Each signal has different samples for each year of Run 2, for a total of three sets of samples per signal.
Furthermore, each signal has separate samples with 50,000 events for the following resonance masses: 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, and $4.5\unit{TeV}$\footnotemark.
\footnotetext{The 2016 \VBF\ZprtoWW and 2016 \VBF\WprtoWZ sets are the exception to this, lacking mass values below $1.2\unit{TeV}$.}
Additional details on the parameters for each model are discussed in section~\ref{sec:sigSamples} of appendix~\ref{chap:appendixSamples}.

% Background samples
Finally, samples are also used to simulate SM background contributions, as listed in tables~\ref{tab:bkg2016Samples} and \ref{tab:bkg2017Samples} along with their cross sections.
These background samples include various processes that are broadly categorized as \Wjets and \WVt, some of which include DY+jets, QCD, and $t\bar{t}$ production samples.
