\chapter{Search for a Heavy Diboson Resonance Produced via Vector Boson Fusion}
\label{chap:analysis}

\section{Introduction}

% Motivation of analysis from theory chapter
In chapter~\ref{chap:theory}, we explored some of the motivation behind BSM searches and examples of BSM theories that predict exotic new particles that may be found in collision events at accelerator facilities.
We also enumerated some of the benchmark models from BSM theories, which were the spin-0 Kaluza-Klein Radion, spin-1 \Wpr/\Zpr boson, and spin-2 Bulk Graviton.
Additionally, we discussed the \VBF production mode that this work focuses on, and the final state that is produced.

% Previous searches
Previous searches have been conducted for dibosonic resonances at both CMS and ATLAS, although none have found evidence of such a resonance being observed at the LHC~\cite{Sirunyan_18,Aaboud_18,Aaboud_18_2,Aad_15,Khachatryan_14,Sirunyan_17,Sirunyan_17_2,atlas20}.
Some of these searches also considered different production modes, as well as other intermediate and final states, such as a \ZZ/\ZH resonance with fully leptonic or hadronic final states.
As mentioned in section~\ref{sec:VBF}, this analysis is itself a continuation of a previous search by the CMS collaboration for a dibosonic resonance using data from 2016.

% VBF analysis as part of the main analysis
While this work focuses on the \VBF production mode, it is one of three modes considered for the full diboson analysis using the Run 2 data.
The other two modes considered involve gluon-gluon fusion (\ggF) and Drell-Yan (\DY) processes.
These additional modes produce identical \lnuqqbarprp and \lnubbbar semileptonic final states, but without the \VBF jets in the forward regions of the detector.
For completeness, we include the full diboson analysis with the non-\VBF production categories in this chapter.
Figure~\ref{fig:nonVbf} shows some example Feynman diagrams of other processes that were considered for the full analysis.

% Details of reconstructing events
In subsection~\ref{subsec:expEvent} we discussed the expected event structure for the decay events of interest, in which the leptonic decay of the $W$ boson results in an $e\nu$ or $\mu\nu$ pair with large missing transverse energy from the neutrino, the hadronic decay of the \VorH boson results in a large single jet with substructure, and \VBF processes produce forward-facing jets.
The boosted topology is a result of the fact that the resonances considered have masses in the TeV range, which causes the $W$ and \VorH bosons to have transverse momenta on the order of several hundred GeV.
This requires the use of specialized techniques to identify and reconstruct the individual $W$ and \VorH bosons based on information from the reconstructed lepton, missing transverse energy of the neutrino, and two-pronged substructure of the jet.
Additionally, the signal models used for the analysis assume that the resonance width is narrow, meaning that the decay width of the resonance in the \WV/\WH diboson mass spectrum is smaller than the experimental resolution.

% Details on modeling background
A unique aspect of the previous analysis that this work inherits is a novel signal extraction method, in which the SM background contribution is estimated from the data using a two-dimensional (2D) maximum likelihood fit.
This process is performed in the plane formed by the mass of the jet from the \VorH decay \MJ, and the invariant mass of the \WV/\WH diboson system \MVV.
Two classes of SM background events are considered for this analysis.
The first is a \WVt background that is resonant in the \MJ spectrum, and the second consists of contributions that are non-resonant in \MJ mainly dominated by \Wjets processes.
Figure~\ref{fig:bkgFeynman} shows example Feynman diagrams for these two types of background.
One advantage of using a 2D fit is the ability to retain more events for modeling background in the sideband regions within the 2D \MJ-\MVV plane, as opposed to looking at the sidebands in the \MJ and \MVV spectra separately.
This also allows for conducting a simultaneous search of \WW, \WZ, and \WH resonances as opposed to performing separate analyses in pre-defined \MJ windows.

    Both cases produce a final state that is similar to the expected final state produced by the \VBF signal process.
    The most common background is a \Wjets process (left), followed by a \WVt process (right).

% Chapter overview (rewrite)
For this chapter, we examine the complete analysis process of the search for a dibosonic resonance produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC with center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=13\unit{TeV}$.
The data used in this analysis were collected over Run 2 with integrated luminosities of $35.9\unit{fb^{-1}}$, $41.5\unit{fb^{-1}}$, and $59.7\unit{fb^{-1}}$, respectively.
Section~\ref{sec:samples} provides an overview of the data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation samples that were used for the analysis.
In section~\ref{sec:events}, we discuss the selection cuts used to determine which events are used from the data and simulation samples, and we enumerate the event categories that are used in the analysis.
For section~\ref{sec:comp}, we check the validity of our selection cuts and categories by comparing the data versus our MC samples in the control regions of the analysis.
We then discuss the process of obtaining $V$-tagging scale factors that are used to model the peak from the leptonically decaying $W$ in section~\ref{sec:vTag}.
The two-dimensional signal extraction method is described in section~\ref{sec:2Dfit}, after which we go over the systematic uncertainties in section~\ref{sec:uncert}.
Finally, the fit validation and bias testing procedures are described in section~\ref{sec:bias}, which are followed by the results of the search in section~\ref{sec:results}.
