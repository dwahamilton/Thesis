\chapter{Search for a Heavy Diboson Resonance Produced via Vector Boson Fusion}
\label{chap:analysis}

\section{Introduction}

% Motivation of analysis from theory chapter
In chapter~\ref{chap:theory}, we explored some of the motivation behind BSM searches and examples of BSM theories that predict exotic new particles that may be found in collision events at accelerator facilities.
We also enumerated some of the benchmark models from BSM theories, which were the spin-0 Kaluza-Klein Radion, spin-1 $W'$/$Z'$ boson, and spin-2 Bulk Graviton.
Additionally, we discussed the VBF production mode that this work focuses on, and the final state that is produced.

% Previous searches
Previous searches have been conducted for dibosonic resonances at both CMS and ATLAS, although none have found evidence of such a resonance being observed at the LHC~\cite{Aaboud_2018,Aaboud_2018_2,Aad_2015,Khachatryan_2014,Sirunyan_2017,Sirunyan_2017_2,atlas2020}.
Some of these searches also considered different production modes, as well as intermediate and final states, such as a $ZZ$/$ZH$ resonance with fully leptonic or hadronic final states.
As mentioned in chapter~\ref{chap:theory}, this analysis is itself a continuation of a previous search by the CMS collaboration for a dibosonic resonance using data from 2016.

% VBF analysis as part of the main analysis
While this work focuses on the VBF production mode, it is one of three modes considered for the full diboson analysis using the Run 2 data.
The other two modes considered involve gluon-gluon fusion and Drell-Yan processes.
These additional modes may produce an identical semileptonic final state, but without the VBF jets in the forward regions of the detector.
For completeness, we include the full diboson analysis with the non-VBF production categories.
Figure~\ref{fig:nonVbf} shows some example Feynman diagrams of other processes that were considered for the full analysis.

% Chapter overview
For this chapter, we examine the complete analysis process of the search for a dibosonic resonance produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC with center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=13\unit{TeV}$.
Section~\ref{sec:samples} provides an overview of the data and simulation samples that were used for the analysis.
In section~\ref{sec:events}, we discuss the selection cuts used to determine which events are used from the data and simulation samples.
We then go over the SM sources of background and how they are taken into account for the analysis in section~\ref{sec:bkg}, followed by the signal modeling process in section~\ref{sec:sig}.
The fit validation and bias testing procedures are described in section~\ref{sec:bias}, after which we discuss the results of the search in section~\ref{sec:results}.

Both cases produce a final state that is similar to the expected final state produced by the VBF signal process. The most common background is the $W$+jets process (left), followed by the $W$+$V$/$t$ process (right).}
