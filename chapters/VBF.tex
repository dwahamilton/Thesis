\chapter{Search for a Heavy Diboson Resonance Produced via Vector Boson Fusion}
\label{chap:search}

\section{Introduction}

% VBF analysis as
As mentioned in chapter~\ref{chap:theory}, this analysis is a continuation of a previous search for a dibosonic resonance using data from 2016.
While this work focuses on the VBF production mode, it is one of three categories for the full diboson analysis using the Run 2 data.
The additional categories have an identical semileptonic final state, but without the additional VBF jets in the forward regions of the detector.
For completeness, we include the full diboson analysis with the non-VBF production categories.

% Chapter overview
In this chapter, we examine the complete analysis process of the search for a dibosonic resonance produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC with center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=13\unit{TeV}$.
Section~\ref{sec:samples} provides an overview of the data and simulation samples that were used for the analysis.
In section~\ref{sec:events}, we discuss the selection cuts used to determine which events are used from the data and simulation samples.
We then go over the SM sources of background and how they are taken into account for the analysis in section~\ref{sec:bkg}, followed by the signal modeling process in section~\ref{sec:sig}.
The fit validation and bias testing procedures are described in section~\ref{sec:bias}, after which we discuss the results of the search in section~\ref{sec:results}.

  \caption{Feynman diagrams of the two main SM sources of background to consider for the search. Both cases produce a final state that is similar to the expected final state produced by the VBF signal process. The most common background is the $W$+jets process (left), followed by the $W$+$V$/$t$ process (right).}
