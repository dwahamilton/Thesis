\section{Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{sec:uncert}

% Uncertainties overview
To implement systematic uncertainties in the analysis, we introduce nuisance parameters into the 2D fit that allow for changes to the shapes and normalizations for the signal and background models.
In this section, we discuss the nuisance parameters that are applied to the signal and background processes, and how they are correlated between different categories.

\subsection{Signal Normalization}

% Signal normalization
The signal normalization uncertainties are 100\% correlated between search categories unless otherwise stated.
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bfseries Luminosity:} Normalization uncertainty of 1.8\% as recommended by the Luminosity POG~\cite{LumiPOG}.
  \item {\bfseries PDF:} Normalization uncertainty of 1\%.
  \item {\bfseries Pileup reweighting:}
  \item {\bfseries Lepton ID and trigger efficiency:}
  \item {\bfseries $b$-tag fake rate:}
  \item {\bfseries $V$-tagging efficiency:}
  \item {\bfseries Momentum dependence of the $V$-tagging efficiency:}
  \item {\bfseries \bbbar-tagging efficiency:}
  \item {\bfseries \Dy cut efficiency:}
\end{itemize}
