\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

% Results overview
The results of the search for a new heavy boson resonance are considered in terms of exclusion limits for the benchmark signal models described in this analysis.
These limits are model-independent, and cover spin-0, spin-1, and spin-2 resonances decaying to \WW, \WZ, and \WH.

\subsection{Exclusion Limits}

% Exclusion limits
We derive 95\% confidence-level (CL) upper limits on the resonance production cross section times branching ratio to \WW, \WZ, or \WH as a function of the mass hypothesis \MX for a narrow resonance, and compare them to expected cross sections from the benchmark models where available.
The resulting limits are shown in figures~\ref{fig:exclusion_limits_spin0}, \ref{fig:exclusion_limits_spin1}, and \ref{fig:exclusion_limits_spin2} for the spin-0, spin-1, and spin-2 signal models, respectively.
These limits are obtained for the combination of all 24 search categories, showing the observed and median expected limits with the 68\% and 95\% expected bands.
