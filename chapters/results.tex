% Results overview
The results of the search for a new heavy boson resonance are considered in terms of exclusion limits for the benchmark signal models described in this analysis.
These limits are model-independent, and cover spin-0, spin-1, and spin-2 resonances decaying to \WW, \WZ, and \WH.
We also consider the observed $p$-values that are used to derive the exclusion limits.

\subsection{Exclusion Limits}

% Asymptotic limits
The exclusion limits obtained for the analysis are asymptotic frequentist limits for the production cross section times the branching ratio for each signal model.
These limits are obtained by using an asymptotic approximation of the distributions for a test statistic $\tilde{q}_\mu$ that is based on a profile likelihood ratio under signal and background hypotheses with signal strength $\mu$, where $\mu=0$ is the background-only model and $\mu=1$ is the nominal signal model~\cite{Cowan_2011}.

% Obtaining limits
The test statistic used is
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{q}_\mu=\begin{cases}
    -2\ln\tilde{\lambda}(\mu) & \hat{\mu}\leq\mu,\\
    0 & \hat{\mu}>\mu,
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where the likelihood ratio $\tilde{\lambda}(\mu)$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\lambda}(\mu)=\begin{cases}
    \frac{\mathcal{L}(\mu,\hat{\hat{\vb*{\theta}}}(\mu))}{\mathcal{L}(\hat{\mu},\hat{\vb*{\theta}})} & \hat{\mu}\geq0,\\
    \frac{\mathcal{L}(\mu,\hat{\hat{\vb*{\theta}}}(\mu))}{\mathcal{L}(0,\hat{\hat{\vb*{\theta}}}(0))} & \hat{\mu}<0,
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
with $\hat{\hat{\vb*{\theta}}}$ corresponding to the conditional maximum likelihood estimators of $\vb*{\theta}$.
After finding the observed test statistic $\tilde{q}_{\mu,\mathrm{obs}}$, we generate toy MCs to construct the pdfs for $\tilde{q}_\mu$ for both signal and background-only experiments.
This is used to find the $p$-value for the signal $p_\mu$, given by
\begin{equation}
  p_\mu=\int_{\tilde{q}_{\mu,\mathrm{obs}}}^\infty f(\tilde{q}_\mu|\mu,\hat{\hat{\vb*{\theta}}}(\mu,\mathrm{obs}))\dd{\tilde{q}_\mu},
\end{equation}
where $f(\tilde{q}_\mu|\mu,\hat{\hat{\vb*{\theta}}}(\mu,\mathrm{obs}))$ is the signal+background pdf for $\tilde{q}_\mu$, and $\hat{\hat{\vb*{\theta}}}(\mu,\mathrm{obs})$ is the conditional maximum likelihood estimate based on the observed data.
The confidence-level (CL) upper limit $CL_s$ is obtained by computing the $p$-value for the background-only hypothesis, defined by
\begin{equation}
  p_b=1-\int_{\tilde{q}_{\mu,\mathrm{obs}}}^\infty f(\tilde{q}_\mu|0,\hat{\hat{\vb*{\theta}}}(0,\mathrm{obs}))\dd{\tilde{q}_\mu},
\end{equation}
with $f(\tilde{q}_\mu|0,\hat{\hat{\vb*{\theta}}}(0,\mathrm{obs}))$ corresponding to the background-only pdf for $\tilde{q}_\mu$.
We then define the $CL_s$ upper limit as
\begin{equation}
  CL_s=\frac{p_\mu}{1-p_b}.
\end{equation}

% Observed limits
We derive 95\% CL upper limits on the resonance production cross section times branching ratio to \WW, \WZ, or \WH as a function of the mass hypothesis \MX for a narrow resonance, and compare them to expected cross sections from the benchmark models where available.
The resulting limits are shown in figures~\ref{fig:exclusion_limits_spin0}, \ref{fig:exclusion_limits_spin1}, and \ref{fig:exclusion_limits_spin2} for the spin-0, spin-1, and spin-2 signal models, respectively.
These limits are obtained for the combination of all 24 search categories, showing the observed and median expected limits with the 68\% and 95\% expected bands.
